# SpectralMethod

Python implementation of the algorithms described in the paper "A new spectral method for Latent Variable Models", by Matteo Ruffini, Marta Casanellas and Ricard Gavald√†.

## Contents of the project:

### RandomGenerator.py

A module that allows the user to generate synthetic texts distributed as a the Single Topic Model or as a Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

### SpectralMehod.py

A module that contains the learning algorithms described in the paper; the user given a set of texts, expressed in the form of a term-document matrix, can use these algorithms to learn the latent variable models generating the texts (in the case of the Single topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

### TestScript.py

A script to generate synthetic texts using the module "RandomGenerator" and learn the hidden model parameters using the module "SpectralMethod".
